## 1. Devices
### 1.1 `/dev` directory
When you connect a device to your machine, it generally needs a device driver to function properly. You can interact with device drivers through device files or device nodes, these are special files that look like regular files. Since these device files are just like regular files, you can use programs such as ls, cat, etc to interact with them. These device files are generally stored in the `/dev` directory.

### 1.2 device types
Before we chat about how devices are managed, let's actually take a look at some devices.
```sh
$ ls -l /dev
```  

Permissions | Owner | Group | Major Device Number | Minor Device Number | Timestamp | Device Name
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
brw-rw---- | 1 root disk     | 8, | 0 | Dec 20 20:13 | sda  
crw-rw-rw- | 1 root root     | 1, | 3 | Dec 20 20:13 | null  
srw-rw-rw- |  1 root root       | 0 | Dec 20 20:13 | log  
prw-r--r-- | 1 root root        | 0 | Dec 20 20:13 | fdata



Remember in the ls command you can see the type of file with the first bit on each line. Device files are denoted as the following:

-   c - character
-   b - block
-   p - pipe
-   s - socket
