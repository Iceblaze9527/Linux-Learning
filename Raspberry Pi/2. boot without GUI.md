# Boot RPi and Enable SSH Connection w/o GUI 

## 1. Enable SSH Connection and Auto Connection to Wi-Fi upon Booting
Reinsert the SD card and you'll see a new externel device named `boot`

Create an empty file named `ssh` under `boot/` and config file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with the following content: 
```json
country=CN
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
	ssid="network_name_with_quotation_marks"
	psk="network_passwd"
	priority=1
	} 
```

You can setup multiple networks available for RPi by adding another `network={}` in the configuration file. The one with larger priority number comes first.

Safely eject the SD device and insert it into RPi. Power on and a green LED shall be on if everything goes smoothly.

## 2. SSH RPi
Usually, the default username for a new RPi is `pi`, with hostname `raspberrypi` and password `raspberry`. So first try on your SSH client `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`, then SSH login should be prompted if your device can find your RPi's IP address successfully; otherwise, you will need to find its IP first.

### 2.1 [Find IP Address for RPi (if necessary)](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-ip-address/)
Several possible ways to find your RPi's IP address (ranked by priority):

- If available, login to your network router to try finding its client list, you will see a client with hostname `raspberrypi`
 and its IP
- Try `ping raspberrypi.local` to retrieve its IP address
- Using `nmap` (this may not work though)

Then you can SSH into your RPi by `ssh pi@ip_address`.

### 2.2 Change Hostname and Password
