# Boot RPi and Enable SSH Connection w/o GUI 

## 1. Enable SSH Connection and Auto Connection to Wi-Fi upon Booting
Reinsert the SD card and you'll see a new externel device named `boot`

Create an empty file named `ssh` under `boot/` and config file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with the following content: 
```json
country=CN
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
	ssid="network_name_with_quotation_marks"
	psk="network_passwd"
	priority=1
	} 
```

You can setup multiple networks available for RPi by adding another `network={}` configuration. The one with larger priority number comes first.

For the official Raspberry Pi OS, if you need to manually log in, the default user name is `pi`, with password `raspberry`. Remember the default keyboard layout is set to UK.
