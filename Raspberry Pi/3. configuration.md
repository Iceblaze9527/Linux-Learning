# Configurations and Development
## 1. Config of RPi
`$ sudo raspi-config` to enable I2C and SPI

check if these are enabled by `$ lsmod`. If I2C enabled, the terminal echoes an `i2c-bcm2835` device, else you can add it manually: `sudo nano /etc/modules` and append:

```sh
i2c-bcm2835
i2c-dev
```

If SPI enabled, the terminal echoes an `spi-bcm2835` device.

## 2. Development
### 2.1 Mirrors (optional)
Change to Tsinghua Mirrors if you like

```sh
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
# add in the file:
deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/raspbian/raspbian/ buster main non-free contrib rpi
deb-src http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/raspbian/raspbian/ buster main non-free contrib rpi

$ sudo /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list
# add in the file:
deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/raspberrypi/ buster main ui
```

### 2.2 Python Environment

ou probably already know the benefits of apt-get. Automatic update notifications, other apt-installed packages that need those tools know they're installed, etc.

With pip, you know you're getting the latest version at the time you install it, you can install to a non-default version of Python, and you can install to a virtualenv.

If you don't need any of the features pip gives you, and you don't routinely have to install other Python packages which aren't available over APT, use the APT versions.

"With pip, you know you're getting the latest version at the time you install it", this could be a crucial point, and I'd like to emphasize something, when you install through apt you're usually restricted to the version of the version(s) of the package _your distro supports_.


```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo apt-get install RPi.GPIO

sudo pip3 install smbus
sudo pip3 install spidev
```

sudo apt-get install python3-imaging

### 2.3 Others

```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```
